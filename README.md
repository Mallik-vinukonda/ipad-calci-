# AI-Powered Calculator

## Introduction

Apple recently introduced a new feature for iPads, but what about Android?
Here's the solution: an AI-powered calculator that can solve complex mathematical equations, including integration and differentiation. Additionally, it allows users to draw something, and the AI will recognize and interpret it.

## Features

- **Advanced Math Solver**: Solve complex problems like integration and differentiation.
- **Equation Solver**: Supports linear equations and other algebraic expressions.
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform simple calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **AI Drawing Recognition**: Draw something, and the AI will identify it.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mallik-vinukonda/ipad-calci-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm i
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # If using JavaScript
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If using Python
   ```

## Usage

- Open the application and enter mathematical equations to get instant solutions.
- Draw objects, and let the AI recognize them.
- Perform basic arithmetic calculations with ease.
